            Inline, Internal and external stylesheet are the ways in which we can style any webpage. <br>
            <strong>Inline: </strong>In inline css we add the styling properties in the tags itself that's why the name inline css. Inline css is not recommended as it is not efficient because we have to add the styling propertiesto every tag present. <br>
            <strong>Internal CSS: </strong>Internal CSS is done by adding &gt;style&lt; tag in the &gt;head&lt; tag. Then in the style tag we add the element we want to style. They can done by using the element name, by selecting ID(#id) and by selecting class name (.class_name). 
            <strong>External CSS: </strong>The external style is done by creating another file with .css extension and linking the .css page to the html file by using the 'link' tag in the head element. All the styling by using the element name, by selecting ID(#id) and by selecting class name (.class_name).

    <h2>Q4. Difference between absolute and relative positioning</h2>
    <div class="q4">
        <p> 
            Position Relative: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.
            <br>
            Position Absolute: The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
